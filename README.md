# Tag Plugin for Nexus Repository OSS

This plugin provides tagging support to Nexus Repository OSS 3.x. Note that this feature is available on
Nexus Repository Pro and it has some advantage above this plugin (better support, better integration, ...). So, it's
intended to be used by whom can not buy Pro version.

# Installation
Download latest release and copy jar bundle to deploy directory of target nexus repository manager.
